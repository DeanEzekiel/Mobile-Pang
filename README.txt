I implemented below bonus tasks which I find challenging and fun. I wanted to implement the other 3 as well, however time didn't allow me, and given the Philippine holidays, I couldn't resist not relaxing from time to time. LOL. I enjoyed the exam, by the way :)

- MVC: Implemented MVC to get more familiar on using MVC for Game Development

- Custom Visuals: To better visualize the game and to enjoy working on it :)

- 3 Distinct Levels: Implemented 3 levels to see how the level menu changes depending on the number of designed levels
